Joypad SDK 
=========

Welcome to the Joypad SDK!  Joypad is the iOS game controller, see [getjoypad.com](http://getjoypad.com "Joypad") for more about that.
This SDK enables you to add iOS controller support directly to your Mac or iPad games (or other apps, if you want to get wild).
The controller that you create through the SDK will appear on any phones running Joypad on the network.  You can add dpads,
virtual analog sticks, and buttons.  You can also get accelerometer input from each phone.
To see pictures, go to [getjoypad.com/sdk.html](http://getjoypad.com/sdk.html "Joypad SDK").

Note: Only the latest version of Joypad is SDK enabled, 
get it for free [here](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/joypad-game-controller/id411422117?mt=8 "Joypad").
